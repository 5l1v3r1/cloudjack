# CloudJack Â» AWS Subdomain Hijacking

### Route53/CloudFront Vulnerability Assessment Utility

CloudJack assesses AWS accounts for subdomain hijacking vulnerabilities due to decoupled Route53 and CloudFront configurations. This vulnerability exists if a Route53 alias references 1) a deleted CloudFront web distribution or 2) an active CloudFront web distribution with deleted CNAME(s).

If this decoupling is discovered by an attacker, they can simply create their own CloudFront web distribution and/or CNAME(s) that match the victim's Route53 A record host name values. Exploitation of this vulnerability results in the attacker's ability to impersonate the victim's web site content, which previously would have been delivered via the victim's CloudFront web distribution and content origin.
